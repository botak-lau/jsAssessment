# jsAssessment
Find Your Hat project


**What did you like about this project?**
i like that it helped me understand js concepts better. The hours googling and reading (not to mention finding out where I left out a "}",  did help me gain a better understanding of some of the concepts. TBH, for some, I know I needed something (e.g. i know need to capture the new locations after the user typed in up or down, but where do i put it and how do i write it?) but have no idea why the syntax is the way it is. I just copied from w3schools and plug it in and replaced the variables until it works.

**What did you struggle with in this project?**
Many many things! But one that is not major but something I need to remind myself is that segments of the codes can move around. I'm quite a linear person (some say logical, but I think that's a stretch) so I struggled a bit with putting all the codes within askQuestion function. Particularly the boundary checks -- eventually I moved it to the runGame function because after the player makes a move, the check should happen there. I did move it down to AskQuestion function when I frinally got the codes error free but moved it up again cos it just didn't sit well with me. 

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
By not doing it? haha.. definitely spent alot alot more than 3 hours 30 mins!!
