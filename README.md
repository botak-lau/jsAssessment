# jsAssessment
Find Your Hat project


**What did you like about this project?**
i like that it helped me understand js concepts better. The hours googling and reading (not to mention finding out where I left out a "}",  did help me gain a better understanding of some of the concepts. TBH, for some, I know I needed something (e.g. i know need to capture the new locations after the user typed in up or down, but where do i put it and how do i write it?) but have no idea why the syntax is the way it is. I just copied from w3schools and plug it in and replaced the variables until it works.

**What did you struggle with in this project?**
Many many things! If Jean had not laid out the codes for steps 1-4, I don't think I would ever know where to start! Having the variables defined for us at the start was relly helpful.

One not so major challenge, which I need to constantly remind myself, is that segments of the codes can be moved around. I'm quite a linear person (some say logical, but I think that's a stretch) so I struggled a bit with putting all the codes within askQuestion function for example. Particularly the boundary checks -- eventually I moved it to the runGame function because after the player makes a move, the check should happen there. I did move it down to AskQuestion function when I finally got the codes error free but moved it up again cos it just didn't sit well with me. 

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
By not doing it? haha.. definitely spent alot alot more than 3 hours 30 mins!!
